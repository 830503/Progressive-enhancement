    <h1>The story</h1>
    <P><b>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. They said,<q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>The
        farmer said, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
        everybody came back and said, <q class =villagers>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
        The farmer again said,<em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></b></em><br>
        <br>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg. The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad, </q> and the farmer responded, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em> The next day the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q>Again, he said, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em><br>
        <br>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good"></em>Good fortune.

        Alan Watts</P>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p ><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad"> Bad </em>are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for
                bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
